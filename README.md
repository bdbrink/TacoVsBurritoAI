# TacoVsBurritoAI

This is a WIP for an application using Azure PaaS to create an AI that can tell you if an obejct is a taco or burrito.

I have created using Custom Vision to train the AI using Tags.

You can add any image and it will give a probability of being a Taco or burrito, and it works for any object.
